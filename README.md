## Info

I'm MikeJollie2707. You can call me Mike or MikeJollie or MJ. I mainly work with C++ and Python (this is mostly for a Discord bot). I also know some basic Java and GAS Assembly on x86_64.

I'm still in school, so I don't have a solid path yet. However, it'll be cool if I can work on games.

## Languages

- C++: I'm comfortable working with C++. Currently using SFML for my games, but I might learn OpenGL if I have time. Also doing some basic AI here.
- Python: I mostly use this to use `discord.py` for my Discord bot. Check it out if you're interested in helping.
- Java: Ew. Imagine teaching students using Java. Couldn't be the universities.
- Assembly: I learned just for fun. Why GAS? The assembly generated by gcc/g++ is in GAS and I find it kinda cool.
