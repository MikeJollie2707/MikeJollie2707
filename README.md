## Info

I'm MikeJollie2707. You can call me Mike or MikeJollie or MJ. I mainly work with C++ and Python (this is mostly for a Discord bot).

## Languages

- C++: I'm comfortable working with C++. I used it for some of the games I wrote.
- Python: I mostly use this for a Discord bot written using `hikari` and `hikari-lightbulb`. It's also useful to get things done quick and dirty.
- Assembly (x86 and MIPS): I learned x86 just for fun. MIPS is part of the uni curriculum.
- Javascript: I worked with React for a few months to maintain and improve a commercial website. Not very fun.
- Rust: Just very basic.
- Java: Just very basic.
