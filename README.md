## Info

I'm MikeJollie2707. You can call me Mike or MikeJollie or MJ. I mainly work with C++ and Python (this is mostly for a Discord bot). I also know some basic Java and Assembly on x86_64 and, very recently, MIPS.

## Languages

- C++: I'm comfortable working with C++. Currently using SFML for my games, but I might learn OpenGL if I have time. Also doing some basic AI here.
- Python: I mostly use this for a Discord bot written using `hikari` and `hikari-lightbulb`. It's also useful to get things done quick and dirty.
- Java: Just very basic.
- Assembly: I learned just for fun. Pretty interesting.
